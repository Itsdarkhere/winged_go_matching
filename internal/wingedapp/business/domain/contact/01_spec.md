### Contact Domain

---
#### V1

The contact domain is where we handle the following logic:

- block user
- unblock user
- unblock all users
- get (many) blocked users 
- get (one) blocked user 

### Gotchas
- we don't have `list all` because we only saved blocked data
- those contact data lives on the user's phones
