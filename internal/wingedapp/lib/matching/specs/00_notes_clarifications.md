#### Clarifications:
- do we have now audio love-story generation for 2 people?

#### Concerns:

#### Todo:
- ui: younes needs to fully integrate the /admin endpoints I did
- admin endpoints commands for MVP:
  - list (expand below)
    - display (and filter) MatchSet, and MatchResult
    - approve, and unapprove match results
    - modify matching settings
    - listen to ideal date audio
    - listen to intro audios
    - process match set matches
- toolings needed
  - trash user generation, need to be able to upload a set of CSVs, and load it into the system
- front-facing endpoints: I need to make user-endpoints on how the matching will progress
  - see current matches
  - unmatch / match / reject / view
  - 
- logging
  - I need to make logs like with what we have with Havard's app

#### Unexpected work:
- admin controls, and toolings (something I need to improve on)
