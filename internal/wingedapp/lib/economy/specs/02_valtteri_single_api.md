#### Requirements:

Making it easier on our IOS dev to integrate with scheduling.
If you analyze scheduling... It's 20+ routes on the user side..
But he wants it UI-centric to not go crazy on the screens..
Like we return UI elements (he'll style it himself) but when he click it.. it should return the equivalnt commands to the user.

Female view steps:
1. connected calendar (ensure this is true lol - use cannot proceed)
2. need statemachine fuck for whatever state we are

Must record what step we are on the scheduling.. you can see existing scheuling her.e. I think we trace the lateset date instance.. but on that date instance.. I dunno if we ttrack the steps..
Steps should be..
- connected calendar
- date type needs to be confirmed
- location needs to be confirmed
- location needs to be confirmed 
- confimration needed
